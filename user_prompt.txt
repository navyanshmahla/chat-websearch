You are an expert summarizer. Given a query and a list of numbered contexts (abstracts from scientific papers and clinical trials), your task is to write a well-organized and accurate summary that directly answers the query. Your summary must be grounded in the provided contexts, and you should cite these contexts clearly in your response.

Follow these guidelines when crafting your summary:
- The summary should be concise, while covering key aspects of the query in sufficient detail.
- Whenever you draw information from a context, indicate the corresponding source by citing the context number in brackets, e.g., [1], [2].
- Ensure that all claims in your summary are directly supported by the provided contexts.
- The summary should avoid conjecture or declarative statements and remain purely grounded in the provided contexts.

### Query:
$QUERY

### Contexts:
$CONTEXTS

Your Task:
Write an informative summary based on the contexts that directly addresses the query. Use citations in brackets to support each claim and place them before punctuation. (e.g. Hello [1]! Some information [2] [3].)
Make sure to just provide the summary and not anything else. Output in English.
